# Sibusiso Khumalo — history (four-layer plan, to 23 Sep 2026)

Moved out of `team/sibusiso.md` when VUKA pivoted to VIGIL + ANCHOR (ADR-0034). Nothing here was deleted; the running log stays in the live file.

## Sequenced work

**Superseded 23 September 2026 by the work order above** — kept for history; do not execute these rows. All hours and dates below are ASSUMPTIONS, subject to availability and gates.

| Date | WBS | Hours | Task | Dependencies | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Sep 13 | 1.3 | 4 | Install and exercise local/CI scanning | none | Clean scan passes; synthetic leak and missing-tool checks fail closed |
| Sep 15 | 3.1 | 4 | Freeze event/API/governance contracts | 1.4 | Both leads and consumers approve versioned schemas |
| Sep 17 | 3.3 | 6 | Port and verify human gate and proof path | 1.4,3.1 | Nonauthor reproduces denial, two-signature and tamper checks |
| Sep 20 | 4.5 | 4 | Run integrated evidence checkpoint | 3.5,4.3,4.4 | Both leads record pass or cut scope; tag only tested snapshot |
| Sep 26 | 7.2 | 4 | Rehearse fallback and scoped hotfix procedure | 7.1 | Rollback works; no bypass of authority or review |

## Interfaces

- Inputs: Remediation evidence from Ipeleng/Lethabo; sensor contract from Vukosi.
- Outputs: Versioned API/events and proof export to Mutarisi/Vukosi/Khutso.
- See docs/OVERLAPS.md; do not silently change a shared version.

## Changed this session

Sibusiso requested and owns this review. Local security-hook tests, clean repository/history scans and PR #2's successful remote checks were reviewed. The intake gate records Sibusiso's approval with those evidence references; this branch contains the resulting corrections.

## Needs and blockers

- Collected predecessor test count remains unverified → owners must run both suites before repeating “440 tests”.
- cloud quota failure → use approved local rehearsal path.
- second-lead contract approval and ADR → Lethabo reviews the proposed event/OpenAPI shapes before they are called frozen.
- PR publication → GitHub CLI reports `gh auth login` is required; branch is pushed and the manual PR URL is available.
- WBS 3.3 runtime → system Python is absent, but bundled Python 3.12.14 is available and was used for the tested governance module; pytest remains unavailable, so tests use standard-library unittest.

Needed dates: before the dependent WBS leaf above; owner records actual evidence and escalation here.

## Definition of done

Every assigned leaf has the independent evidence in the table, reviewer acceptance, relevant checks, honest built/specified/simulated status, an updated personal log and BUILD-LOG entry, and business handoff when capability changes. Blocked tasks remain blocked; no inferred approval from elapsed time.

## Outside-role work

- Venue network rehearsal.
- independent proof-verifier instructions.
- release archive and rollback inventory.

These are proposed additional contributions, not unbudgeted critical-path commitments. Agree ownership and time with leads before starting.
